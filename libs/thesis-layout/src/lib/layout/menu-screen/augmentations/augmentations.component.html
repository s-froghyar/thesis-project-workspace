<h2>Audio augmentations</h2>
<p>
    Some augmentations of audio signals take an extra step
    compared to standard spatial transformations on images
    would, as the image, the Mel-Spectrogram, is not generated
    until the transformation is applied. For this work pitch shift and 
    Gaussian noise injection were chosen as the transformations.

        <h2>Pitch Shift</h2>
        <p>
            Pitch shifting is an augmentation
            technique to create multiple samples from an audio signal
            by the transposition of its tone.
            In order to implement it, Librosa was used. Their API allowed a simple parameter 
            to be used to shift the pitch by a certain tone.
            It is however worth noting from the figure that pitch shift drastically changes the spectrogram 
            as well as the fact that librosa uses the CPU to augment the samples which considerably elongated the training time.

        <h2>Gaussian noise injection</h2>
        <p>
            For Gaussian noise, the governing parameter is the signal-to-noise ratio. The original author's only used 
            random noise added to the signal or none, thus duplicating their training set. It was decided to use 2 different levels of 
            noise levels (namely SNR-9 and SNR-12) on top of a clean sample.
